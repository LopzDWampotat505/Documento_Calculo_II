abstract = {This chapter introduces principles for understanding and designing complex systems. It explains that although the real world is analog, digital designers discipline themselves to use a discrete subset of possible signals. In particular, binary variables have just two states: 0 and 1, also called FALSE and TRUE or LOW and HIGH. Logic gates compute a binary output from one or more binary inputs. Logic gates are commonly built from CMOS transistors, which behave as electrically controlled switches. nMOS transistors turn ON when the gate is 1. pMOS transistors turn ON when the gate is 0.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Logic synthesis is the process of automatic production of logic components, in particular digital circuits. It is a subject about how to abstract and represent logic circuits, how to manipulate and transform them, and how to analyze and optimize them. Not only does it play a crucial role in the electronic design automation flow, its techniques also find broader applications in formal verification, software synthesis, and other fields. This chapter covers classic elements of logic synthesis for combinational circuits. After introducing basic data structures for Boolean function representation and reasoning, technology-independent logic minimization, technology-dependent circuit optimization, timing analysis, and timing optimization are discussed. Some advanced subjects and important trends are presented as well for further exploration. Logic synthesis is the process that takes place in the transition from the register-transfer level to the transistor level. It bridges the gap between high-level synthesis and physical design automation. Given a digital design at the register-transfer level, logic synthesis transforms it into a gate-level or transistor-level implementation. The highly engineered process explores different ways of implementing a logic function optimal with respect to some desired design constraints. The physical positions and interconnections of the gate layouts are then further determined at the time of physical design.}
